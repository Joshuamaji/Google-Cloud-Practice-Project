# LAB; Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

## Objectives;

 In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:
   -Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

   -Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

   -Connect between the two instances.

## Steps;

1. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

  gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default"

 -To create a firewall rule to allow http traffic
  gcloud compute firewall-rules create allowhttp --action=ALLOW --destination=INGRESS --rules=http:80 --target-tags=http




2. Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line

   -To display a list of all the zones in the region assigned to you by qwiklabs, enter the below command followed by the assigned region
   gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1

   -Choose a zone from that list other than the zone to which Qwiklabs assigned you
   us-central1-b

   -To set your default zone to the one you just chose
   gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b

   -To create a VM instance called my-vm-2 in that zone, execute this command:
   gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default"


3. Connect between VM instances

 - Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
     -connect to my-vm-2
         gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2

     -ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2
         ping -c 4 my-vm-1

- Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:
    ssh my-vm-1


- At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:
    sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

- Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:
    sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

- Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:
    Hi from YOUR_NAME
    -  Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.

- Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
    curl http://localhost/

-To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command: exit

    You will return to the command prompt on my-vm-2

-To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
    curl http://my-vm-1/

Result: The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.


-Get the external IP address for my-vm-1 from this command:
   gcloud compute instances lists --zone us-central1-a

-copy and pate the external ip adress from above into a new tab in your web browser and click Enter, You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text.
